Problem Statement
The current website does not allow customers to view the menu, place orders for pick-up, or make reservations. Additionally, there aren't any customer experience views on the website just an order form that does not allow customers to see what they are ordering. The problem is perpetually happening because the previous designer/developer did not complete the project. We haven't identified the real financial impact of the current state. 

The problem statement should address these questions:
* What is wrong, not working and not meeting our customer’s needs?
* When and where do the problems occur?
* What is the frequency of the problem?
* What’s the impact of the problem on our customers/business or employees?
* What is the financial impact of the project and/or problem?

Goal Statement
Create a website where customers can view the menu, place orders through square, and make reservations.

Business Case & Benefits
The Business Case should address these questions:
This project is worth doing because it is in alignment with the mission, vision, and purposes with WB3. It is important to do now as it creates a market introduction to the Germantown Marketplace which is in accordance with the goals of the CUS-ACQ-PM project. The consequences of failure to achieve the goals creates unnecessary friction in the market penetration strategy for the Germantown marketpalce. This fits in with CUS-ACQ-PM Project because we are beginning to introduce the brand to the market place.
